Minecraft is available in multiple game modes, each offering a different experience:

1. **Survival Mode** – Players must gather resources, build structures, and fend off hostile mobs while managing their health and hunger.  
2. **Creative Mode** – Provides unlimited resources and allows players to build freely without worrying about health or enemies.  
3. **Hardcore Mode** – Similar to Survival Mode but with permanent death, making it highly challenging.  
4. **Adventure Mode** – Designed for custom maps where players interact with the world differently based on predefined rules.  
5. **Spectator Mode** – Allows players to observe the world without interacting, perfect for exploring without interference.
