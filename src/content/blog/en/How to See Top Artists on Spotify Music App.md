## **Can I Check the Top Artists on the Spotify Music App? \-H2**

This question is quite interesting, as many users ask or search for the feature to find top artists on the official Spotify app. But do you know what the twist is? Spotify does not offer this feature of showing top artists.

The obvious answer is that you cannot check the top artist on the Spotify app officially. But, don't get disappointed, as you know, there are different other ways which you can use to know your most listened to artist. 

However, in the official app, the feature of **Spotify wrapped** will help you to know your activity on Spotify over a year. It will also tell you how many minutes you spend listening to your favorite music in a year. Is it amazing?

**Conclusion \-H2**

Millions of people use and listen to Spotify songs on a daily basis, but no one knows what their preferred tastes, song categories, or top artists they often listen to, right?  

The same was the situation with me, but I searched for different ways to know my favorite or most listened-to artist.  
For this reason, you can use various apps or websites, such as **Statistics for Spotify, Stats.fm,** or any other source, to explore your Spotify stats. Why use third-party apps? So, the reason is Spotify does not show any feature to look into your artist's history.
